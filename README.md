# DnDBeyond_NPC_Service
Computer Science Capstone Project: Create a NPC (non-playable character) generator service for Hasbro's DnDBeyond. 

The different branches include the source files, milestone presentations, and final product images.

This project was in collaboration with DnDBeyond to create a NPC Generator that allows users to access a NPC storage webpage called 'MyNPCs' to create a NPC, either by random selections or by importing an already made playable character. After creating a NPC, the user has access to the NPC sheet on a webpage called 'NPCPage', allowing an interactive and user friendly experience, styled after DnD's npc sheets. The function is to make NPC data interactable and trackable for users. Features include: trackable data (spells, items, etc.), hideable UI elements, and easy creation of NPCs. 

Aside from myself, the team included Brion Gahl (https://github.com/BrionGahl) and Prem Rana (https://github.com/ranamerp), as well as collaboration with members from DnDBeyond: Patrick Backmann (Project Manager), Jason Bush (Software Developer), and Ben Dixon (Software Developer).

My duties involved team lead, design/styling of webpages, development of webpages (such as NPCRandom), and the design/styling of the Milestone presentations.
